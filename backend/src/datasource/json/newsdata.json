He was the guy who unleashed a shitstorm across corporate Canada and within the corridors the CRA ( Canada’s version of the IRS), when in 2005 he wrote in op-ed in the Globe and Mail on why Bell Canada should convert itself into an income trust. When a company does this, they no longer pay corporate income taxes, and pass income through directly to their unit holders. Doing so would save the mega-conglomerate close to $1B CAD in taxes annually. They decided it was such a good idea they went ahead and announced they would do it. Their rival Telus concurred, actually announcing their conversion even before Bell did. In fact this became somewhat of a trend across boardrooms nationwide.","related":"IRS,IRYA-GB,IRYA-GM,IRYA-GS,IRYA-GF,IRSA-AF,TU,T-CT","image":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/nM3TzmpW7g00h92TmkNRV6Tt6M3TdxzEZPBjsdJT0SU","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1647356368000,"headline":"TELUS: 3 Reasons I Sold","source":"Seeking Alpha","url":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/1pYvWh9JQNBiBHQbLuK7iz00PKLRsNbBcooA9g3ALTbW","summary":"No summary available.","related":"TU,T-CT","image":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/1pYvWh9JQNBiBHQbLuK7iz00PKLRsNbBcooA9g3ALTbW","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1647017015000,"headline":"TELUS: One Growth Bubble Waiting To Implode","source":"Seeking Alpha","url":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/3Qg6fUjguhPmE8s668agDGw838emjF5UaSwXmqsTujVn","summary":"No summary available.","related":"TU,T-CT","image":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/3Qg6fUjguhPmE8s668agDGw838emjF5UaSwXmqsTujVn","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1646336878000,"headline":"Samsung and Telus deploy Canada’s first MCPTX service for emergency responders","source":"IT World Canada","url":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/3qzc7fDY54EI9Atao4qq3X1UCYdPjVrpAVGi4gB1xdoq","summary":"Samsung Networks, Samsung’s carrier and operator business wing, announced on March 3 that it has partnered with Telus to deploy Canada’s first Mission Critical Push-to-X (MCPTX) services to provide richer information to first responders.

The growth in this market is mainly attributed to the increasing incidence of intolerance for animal proteins, nutritional benefits offered by plant-based food, increasing vegan population, and venture investments in plant- based food. Moreover, emerging economies provide significant opportunities for players operating in the global plant-based food market. Pandemic challenges in 2021 impacted the plant-based industry in divergent ways, as more consumers experimented at home and operators across restaurants and retail prioritized inventory over innovation. An article in The Food Institute said: \"\"At retail, we are seeing the biggest [plant-based] players continue to grow volume, and smaller players cede share, underscoring how important scale has been to deal with pandemic-related production and supply chain issues,\" senior analyst Jennifer Bartashus of Bloomberg Intelligence told The Food Institute .","related":"TTCF,OTLY,VGFC","image":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/2CSs6S8od0zB12DZfpA7sBxa7ebfhNIqRn610MgHJafP","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1647431871000,"headline":"The Very Good Food Company lowering production, headcount","source":"Seeking Alpha","url":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/3IAgPtftFnWtW8MqG6t5Q2cU9pXWRIhLfEv71pYFFRPj","summary":"The Very Good Food Company (VGFC) is rising 1.58% premarket after the firm says that the company is temporarily lowering production throughput and headcount to manage inventory levels,…","related":"VGFC","image":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/3IAgPtftFnWtW8MqG6t5Q2cU9pXWRIhLfEv71pYFFRPj","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false},{"datetime":1646990559000,"headline":"78 Biggest Movers From Yesterday","source":"Benzinga","url":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/dP6IS29ouHYeKpbyrKhsXBhSW2wbH3AKsrLWLKezPhU","summary":"Gainers Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: HYMC ) shares jumped 138.1% to close at $1.50 on Thursday after dropping 37% on Wednesday.

On the other hand, Crohn''s disease can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus.

That would be Irwin D. Simon, chairman and CEO of Tilray Brands Inc. (NASDAQ: TLRY ). After some 30 years in executive roles at various consumer packaged goods companies from organic and natural foods to personal care initiatives, Simon landed on cannabis, at least for now. This year, at the upcoming Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference , to be held on April 20 and April 21 at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach Hotel in Florida, Simon will deliver the keynote speech and share his vast knowledge and experience across this booming industry. Prior to joining Tilray in May 2021, Simon was known as the visionary who transformed Aphria into a profitable global cannabis company with leading market share brands. When the two large marijuana operators decided to join their forces and create a company with a combined market cap of $3.3 billion last spring, Simon was essential to the deal . Under the merger agreement, Simon was elected as CEO of the resulting company, which was projected to generate roughly $81 million in annual pre-tax cost synergies within the following eighteen months. ‘I’m Not A Quitter’ Considering that Simon faced considerable challenges when he joined Aphria in 2018 , which at the time was affected by a short-sellers report , it made perfect sense that Tilray wanted a person like him at its helm. \"I remember calling my wife and telling her, ''What am I doing?\" Simon told Bloomberg . \"But I ''m not a quitter .","related":"TLRY","image":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/38PBXuIcHvYhrD2swRn2hA858td6f570RzqQeU1Sotyh","lang":"en","hasPaywall":false}],"ABCL":[{"datetime":1647886382000,"headline":"Qu Biologics raises US$12m in latest effort to recruit workers amid labour crunch","source":"Business In Vancouver","url":"https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/254jFdedojfvxbzzgmxect0vw8vQ2kkGAsEMKMzvaKhA","summary":"Add another B.C. life sciences company to the growing list of those on the hunt for more workers.

CP Rail entered a work stoppage on Sunday (March 20) after the company and the union’s leadership were unable to negotiate a settlement or agree to binding arbitration, Canada’s Labor Minister Seamus O’Regan said in a statement posted online. “The work stoppage has begun, but CP and Teamsters are still at the table with federal mediators,” O’Regan said. “Parties are working through the night. We are monitoring the situation closely and expect the parties to keep working until they reach an agreement.” About 3,000 of CP Rail’s locomotive engineers and conductors voted earlier this month in favor of going on strike if a new collective agreement isn’t reached. The union is pushing for improved wages, benefits, and pensions, and has said it’s willing to remain at the bargaining table beyond the March 20 deadline.

The gold market has recently climbed to its highest level since August 2020 on 8 March as investors sought safe-haven assets in response to current world events. The precious metal has reversed a decline seen in late January. It remains under pressure from the prospect of several interest rate hikes in the US this year, which had been expected to weigh on the gold price in 2022. Comments from US Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman Jerome Powell have prompted some market analysts to expect as many as five interest rate hikes this year.
